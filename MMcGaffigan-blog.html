    <h1>My Musical Journey</h1>
    <p>Welcome to All About Mike! As you know by now, I've spent the last few years of my life being a traveling musician, playing drums in a band. I've never gone into detail about how I got started, or what I did to get that opportunity. Today that changes! This week's post will be about how I got started, and where I'm at now.</p>

    <h2>How it started</h2>
    <article><p>Ever since I was a child, I've been very drawn to music. I recognized that all music had a pattern and it fascinated me. My parents signed me up for piano lessons when I was nine to further nurture my interest. After time, I grew bored of piano, as I got into heavier, louder music. I began playing drums when I was 13, and guitar when I was 15. I became immediatley fixated on both instruments and began playing guitar in a band when I was 18. After playing guitar in a local punk band for a few months, I decided to switch over to drums and played in a grunge band from ages 18-22. Upon moving to Marquette, Michigan at age 22, I joined a different punk band who wanted to take their act on the road. </p></article>
    <h2>Where I'm at now</h2>
    <article> <p>After leaving the previously mentioned band in April of this year, I took some time to myself to reflect on where I wanted to go with the music. Currently, I'm putting more time into writing and recording my own music, as well as drumming in a local Folk-Rock band and Serving as a fill-in drummer for the very popular, Michigan-based act, Liquid Mike! Overall, I'm thankful for the ups and downs, and everything in between that has made this journey what it is.

    <p>It's never wrong to follow your passion! I believe following your passion is the key to a happy life.</p>
